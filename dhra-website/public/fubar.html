        <h1>"ABOUT US"</h1>   
        <p>" Harm reduction is a set of ideas and practices to help reduce harms associated with drug use.

Dallas Harm Reduction Aid was created to provide resources and supplies for clean and safe drug use. We also provide and carry Narcan to prevent unnecessary overdose deaths.

We proudly serve Dallas and North Texas. There are no judgements, no questions asked, and everyone remains anonymous."</p>
        <h2>"SERVICES" </h2>
        <p>"Clean Supplies
Evidence shows that providing clean supplies stop the spread of HIV and hepatitis. It also encourages the user to seek treatment. We provide the following kits:

Safe Injection
Safe Smoking
Safe Snorting
Safe Sex
We also provide Narcan to help prevent overdoses as well as fentanyl testing strips.

Resources
DHRA is just one of the mutual aid groups DFW has to offer. We have compiled a list of aids and various other resources to help users and others in need."</p>
